# Reinforcement Learning

* OK, I'll bite. What's Reinforcement Learning? *
Suppose you wanted to build a program to play a game like Space Invaders, or Chess, or Go. Any game where you pick up rewards along the way (in Space Invaders) or at the end (by winning in Chess), and you want to maximise your score. That's what Reinforcement Learning is for.

* So it's just for games? *
It's the field for any kind of automated goal seeking - like, for example, self-driving cars.

* And Dynamic Programming? *
I'm getting there!
